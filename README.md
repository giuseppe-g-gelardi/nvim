# Neovim Config

### things to install

- Neovim
- LazyGit
- Ripgrep -- for telescope/fuzzyfinding
- Some kind of C compiler -- for language parsers
- alacritty (for linux), iterm2 (for mac)

## Warp also works (on both) but interferes with some keybindings for tmux and neovim as well as undercurls for anything but errors (warnings, info, hint, etc dont work).
